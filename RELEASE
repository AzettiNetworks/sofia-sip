Release notes for Sofia-SIP 1.11.6
==================================

Changes since last release

should be compatible with new style with proper include paths, a sed script
for converting source files to use new kind of headers is provided. There
has been further improvements with STUN. 100rel handling in nua has been
improved.

  to modify include directives to use "sofia-sip/foo.h" instead of "foo.h"

  (these renames are handled with scripts/fix-include-sofia-sip, too)
