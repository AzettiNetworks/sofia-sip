API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

<see previous release notes at
 http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/relnotes/ for examples ;
 - should include all changes to public headers, and 
   other important information to developers; 
 - and should be updated _continuously_! />

general:
- The Sofia-SIP m4 macros are no longer installed to /usr/share/aclocal/.

libsofia-sip-ua:
- Added nutag_early_answer. Optionally including SDP answer already in 1XX
  response.
- Done some 64-bit cleanup. Added typedefs isize_t, usize_t and issize_t. By
  default isize_t is int, usize_t is unsigned and issize_t is int and there
  is no change in API. If ./configure option --disable-size-compat is given,
  API uses size_t or ssize_t instead of int/unsigned int.
- Changed argument and return type of inline function t_xtra() to size_t.
- Using socklen_t as li_addrlen.
- Added soa tag soatag_audio_aux.
- Added nua tag nutag_refer_with_id.
- Added network change detection logic. This extends current su API
  with two functions defined in su_os_nw.h. Also a new event
  nua_i_network_changed and tag NUTAG_DETECT_NETWORK_UPDATES are
  introduced.
- Added nta_leg_make_replaces() and nta_leg_by_replaces() functions
- Added urltag_scan()
- template: Added foobar() function (sofia-sip/foobar.h).
- The install location of awk scripts (msg_parser.awk and 
  tag_dll.awk) from libexec to share/sofia-sip/. Also added 
  a new pkg-config variable to find out the awk scripts: 
  sh> pkg-config --variable=sofiaawkdir sofia-sip-ua
- This release is ABI/API compatible with applications 
  linked against 1.12.0. The ABI has been tested with the nua
  module unit test (test_nua) built against original 1.12.0 release.

libsofia-sip-ua-glib:
- Added sofia-sip/su_glib.h. The old sofia-sip/su_source.h is 
  deprecated, but still present. Similarly the functions su_root_source()
  and su_root_source_create() have been deprecated and replaced with
  su_glib_root_create() and su_glib_root_gsource().
- Added nua_glib::cancel-answered signal - emitted when the stack
  receives an answer to previously sent CANCEL.
- This release is ABI/API compatible with libsofia-sip-ua-glib of 1.12.0. Note, 
  libsofia-sip-ua-glib interface is NOT considered stable and may change in 
  a future 1.12.x release.
