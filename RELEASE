==============================================

Changes since last release
--------------------------

<changes since last written in freshmeat.net "Changes:" style;
 and in less than 10 lines, written in 3rd person English, with
 complete sentences />

Bugs in blaa and foo have been fixed. The stack now supports
use of foobar...

API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

<see previous release notes at
 http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/relnotes/ for examples ;
 - should include all changes to public headers, and 
   other important information to developers; 
 - and should be updated _continuously_! />

**template**: New features in API are marked with Doxytag macro @VERSION_1_XX_X.

libsofia-sip-ua:
- **template**: Added foobar() function (sofia-sip/foobar.h).
- Added kqueue and /dev/poll interfaces (su_devpoll_port_create(),
  su_devpoll_clone_start(), su_kqueue_port_create(), su_kqueue_clone_start()
  in <sofia-sip/su_wait.h>)
- Added SIP_IS_ALLOWED() macro to <sofia-sip/sip_util.h>
- Fixed NUTAG_APPL_METHOD() implementation for UPDATE and PRACK as documented
  ("100rel" and "precondition" extensions now require explicit calls to
  nua_update() and nua_prack() if those methods are included in
  NUTAG_APPL_METHOD())
- This release is ABI/API compatible with applications linked against 
  any 1.12.x release. However, applications built against this release won't 
  work against an older library. The ABI has been tested with the nua module 
  unit test (test_nua) built against original 1.12.0 release.

libsofia-sip-ua-glib:
- No ABI/API changes, compatible with 1.12.0. Note, libsofia-sip-ua-glib
  interface is not considered stable and may change in a future 1.12.x
  release.
