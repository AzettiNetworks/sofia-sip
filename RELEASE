API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

<see previous release notes at
 http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/relnotes/ for examples ;
 - should include all changes to public headers, and 
   other important information to developers; 
 - and should be updated _continuously_! />

- Renamed sofia-sip/features.h as sofia-sip/sofia_features.h
  (it got confused with glibc features.h)
- Added nta_check_*() functions to <sofia-sip/nta.h>
- The glib dependent parts of libsofia-sip-ua have been moved
  to a separate library - libsofia-sip-ua-glib. This change
  will require a recompilation of clients using the sofia-sip 
  glib event loop integration. See following sofia-sip-devel
  mail for details:
  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.telephony.sofia-sip.devel/164
- A new glib/gobject based interface to sofia-sip has been
  added to the package. This code was originally written 
  by Rob Taylor for the telepathy-sip package (see 
  http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/ ). This interface is still
  subject to change during the 1.11.x development series.
