API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

<see previous release notes at
 http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/relnotes/ for examples ;
 - should include all changes to public headers, and 
   other important information to developers; 
 - and should be updated _continuously_! />

[libsofia-sip-ua]
- Library interface version 0 is now frozen. All 1.12.x releases will
  maintain API/ABI compatibility with v0 interface. Library 
  soname is 'libsofia-sip-ua.so.0'.
- Added sofia-sip/hostdomain.h:host_is_local() (implemented
  by the bnf module).

[libsofia-sip-ua-glib]
- Unlike the main library, the glib bindings are not yet part of 
  the API/ABI stable library set. For this release, the soname will be 
  set to 'libsofia-sip-ua-glib.so.0', but interface - and the soname - 
  may be changed in later 1.12 releases.
- Applications must now separately check for libsofia-sip-ua-glib
  with pkg-config. The pkg-config dependency 'libsofia-sip-ua ->
  libsofia-sip-ua-glib' has been removed. See sf.net bug #1446635.
