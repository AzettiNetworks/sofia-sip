README / Sofia-SIP - a RFC3261 compliant SIP User-Agent library
===============================================================

Introduction
------------

Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP  User-Agent library, compliant 
with the IETF RFC3261 specification. It can be used as 
a building block for SIP client software for uses such as VoIP, 
IM, and many other real-time and person-to-person communication 
services. The primary target platform for Sofia-SIP is 
GNU/Linux. Sofia-SIP is based on a SIP stack developed at 
the Nokia Research Center. Sofia-SIP is licensed under the LGPL.


Quick start
-----------

Sofia-SIP uses the GNU autotools, so building procedure
is the usual:

sh> ./autogen.sh (if building from CVS)
sh> ./configure
sh> make
sh> make install

See the "options-client-example" module in Sofia-SIP CVS-tree
for an example of a small app that is utilizing Sofia-SIP,
and specifically the libsofia-sip-ua library component.

There are also multiple example clients under
the "sofia-sip/utils" directory:

- nua_cli, console mode test application for Sofia-SIP
- sip-options, query SIP OPTIONS
- sip-date, SIP date printer/parser
