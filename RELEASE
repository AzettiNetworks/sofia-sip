  sip_headers_as_url_query(), sip_url_query_as_taglist(),
  url_query_as_header_string(), url_unescape_to(),
  msg_header_parse_str()

Notes on new features
---------------------

Query part in SIP URIs is now handled by nta and nua. The SIP URI can
contain a query part separated with the "?", which specifies SIP headers
that are included in the request constructed from the URI. For example,
using URI <sip:example.com?subject=test> would include Subject header
with value "test" in the request.
