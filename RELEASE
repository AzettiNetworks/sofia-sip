Changes since last release

API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

<see previous release notes at
 http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/relnotes/ for examples ;
 - should include all changes to public headers, and 
   other important information to developers; 
 - and should be updated _continuously_! />

- Added su_yield() function.
- Removed sofia-sip/sha1.h from the library. This removal is
  not considered as an API change, but instead a bugfix to 
  the 1.12.0 API/ABI. We know of no applications that are using 
  the sha1.h functionality, so applying this change as a bugfix
  was seen as an acceptable action. If however some application
  relying on sha1.h is found, please contact the sofia-sip team 
  and we will reconsider the issue. See sf.net bug #1525308 for 
  the history of this issue.
- This release is ABI/API compatible with applications 
  linked against 1.12.0.
