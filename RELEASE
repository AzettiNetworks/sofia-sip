==============================================
Release notes for current version of Sofia-SIP
==============================================

Changes since last release
--------------------------

Lots of bugfixes have been made to both library code, and to 
the build system. This is the first release with a stable 
API/ABI for libsofia-sip-ua.

API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

[libsofia-sip-ua]
- Library interface version 0 is now frozen. All 1.12.x releases will
  maintain API/ABI compatibility with v0 interface. Library 
  soname has been set to 'libsofia-sip-ua.so.0'.
- Added sofia-sip/hostdomain.h:host_is_local() (implemented
  by the bnf module).

[libsofia-sip-ua-glib]
- Unlike the main library, the glib bindings are not yet part of 
  the API/ABI stable library set. For this release, the soname will be 
  set to 'libsofia-sip-ua-glib.so.0', but interface - and the soname - 
  may be changed in later 1.12 releases.
- Applications must now separately check for libsofia-sip-ua-glib
  with pkg-config. The pkg-config dependency 'libsofia-sip-ua ->
  libsofia-sip-ua-glib' has been removed. See sf.net bug #1446635.

[others]
- RPM spec-file (packages/sofia-sip.spec): the glib subpackage has
  been renamed to sofia-sip-glibVER, where 'VER' is the current 
  SONAME version number (not the same as libtool interface version!).
