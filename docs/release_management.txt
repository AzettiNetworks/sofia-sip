The release notes
=================

The release notes should contain the following
sections:

- about Sofia-SIP
    - copied verbatim from sofia-sip/README
- list of changes since last release
    - maintained in sofia-sip/RELEASE
- notes on API/ABI interface changes 
    - maintained in sofia-sip/RELEASE
- contributors to this release
    - maintained in sofia-sip/RELEASE
    - also sofia-sip/AUTHORS should be updated

Making the release tarball 
==========================

- update the version number in sofia-sip/configure.ac
- make sure everything that is supposed to be in the
  release is in CVS
- tag CVS-tree with release tag: 'rel-sofia-sip-x_y_z', where
  x_y_z is the version number (see README.developers)
- run 'make distcheck' (requires automake-1.7 or newer)
- calculate md5 and sha1 hashes using md5sum and sha1sum utils,
  and copy the values to the release-notes (see below)


Creating the release notes
==========================

- combine the sofia-sip/RELEASE contents with
  the template found from sfnet_www/templates/relnotes.txt
- store the resulting release notes to 
  sfnet_www/relnotes/relnotes-sofia-sip-x.y.z.txt
- commit the change to CVS, and run the 
  sfnet_www/put_online.sh script at the sourceforge.net
  shell server

Uploading the release to sourceforge.net
========================================

- use the the 'Admin' -> 'File releases' tool for
  creating a new release
- to upload the file, you can use for example ncftpput:
  ncftpput -u anonymous -p USER@users.sourceforge.net upload.sourceforge.net /incoming/ sofia-sip-x.y.z.tar.gz
- attach the release notes (relnotes-sofia-sip-x.y.z.txt)
  to the file release

Announcing releases
===================

- send an announcement mail, containing the
  release notes, to sofia-sip-devel@isource.nokia.com
- post a news item to freshmeat.net 'sofia-sip'
  project (current project owner: Kai Vehmanen)
