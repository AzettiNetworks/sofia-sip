This release include mainly bugfixes and a few improvements in event
handling in nua interface. 

A check-based test program was added, too.


API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

<see previous release notes at
 http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/relnotes/ for examples ;
 - should include all changes to public headers, and 
   other important information to developers; 
 - and should be updated _continuously_! />

New features in API are marked with Doxytag macro @NEW_1_12_8 or
@VERSION_1_12_8.

libsofia-sip-ua:
- Added nta_sip_is_internal(), nta_msg_is_internal() function in
  <sofia-sip/nta.h>. Deprecating nta_is_internal_msg().
- Added su_msg_new(), su_msg_send_to() and su_msg_deinitializer() for more 
  robust and light-weight message passing in <sofia-sip/su_wait.h>
- Added su_home_lock(), su_home_trylock(), and su_home_unlock() in
  <sofia-sip/su_alloc.h>
- Added type-neutral template macros for hash tables HTABLE2_DECLARE2(), HTABLE2_PROTOS2(),
  and HTABLE2_BODIES2().
- Added sres_cache_set_srv_priority() in <sofia-resolv/sres_cache.h> and 
  sres_set_cached_srv_priority() <sofia-resolv/sres.h> for graylisting
  SRV records for inresponsive servers.
- nua_create()/nta_agent_create()/tport_bind() now joins to multicast group
  if "maddr" parameter is specified
- This release is ABI/API compatible with applications linked against 
  any 1.12.x release. However, applications built against this release won't 
  work against an older library. The ABI has been tested with the nua module 
  unit test (test_nua) built against original 1.12.0 release.

libsofia-sip-ua-glib:
- No ABI/API changes, compatible with 1.12.0. Note, libsofia-sip-ua-glib
  interface is not considered stable and may change in a future 1.12.x
  release.
