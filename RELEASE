Release notes for current version of Sofia-SIP
==============================================

API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

- Renamed sofia-sip/features.h as sofia-sip/sofia_features.h
  (it got confused with glibc features.h)
- Added nta_check_*() functions to <sofia-sip/nta.h>
- Renamed NTATAG_RPORT() as NTATAG_CLIENT_RPORT()
- Added sip_via_port()
- Added host_is_*() functions to <sofia-sip/hostdomain.h>
- Added su_node_identifier(), su_clone_pause(), su_clone_resume()
- Moved errors missing from win32 to su_errno.h/su_errno.c.
- Defining AI_MASK, EAI_BADHINTS and EAI_PROTOCOL if they are missing
- Added macro SU_ADDRLEN()
- Updated stun_handle_process_message(), added stun_process_request().
- The glib dependent parts of libsofia-sip-ua have been moved
  to a separate library - libsofia-sip-ua-glib. This change
  will require a recompilation of clients using the sofia-sip 
  glib event loop integration. See following sofia-sip-devel
  mail for details:
  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.telephony.sofia-sip.devel/164
- A new glib/gobject based interface to sofia-sip has been
  added to the package. This code was originally written 
  by Rob Taylor for the telepathy-sip package (see 
  http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/ ). This interface is still
  subject to change during the 1.11.x development series.
