Release notes for current version of Sofia-SIP
==============================================

Changes since last release
--------------------------

<changes since last written in freshmeat.net "Changes:" style;
 and in less than 10 lines, written in 3rd person English, with
 complete sentences />

Bugs in blaa and foo have been fixed. The stack now supports
use of foobar...

- Application can feed hashed passwords (HA1) instead of plain text
  password to the iptsec authentication library

- Using NTATAG_EXTRA_100() with server transactions. Applications can now
  control whether stack sends extra 100 Trying responses after N1 timer
  or retransmissions.

- nta_leg_tag(leg, NULL) now always returns the tag (old or new).

- SOA uses addresses present in SDP if they are local.

- Deferrable timers were added.

- Timing out forked INVITE client transactions is now done by stack.
  The stack generates a 408 response to each INVITE transaction fork that
  has not received a final response within 32 seconds (or 64 times SIP T1)
  after first final response to the INVITE was received.

- An INVITE transaction that has been timed out with stack timer C is now
  CANCELed automatically. Previously, such INVITE client transactions
  were restarted instead of timing out under certain circumstances.

- Timing out forked INVITE client transactions is now done by stack.
  The stack generates a 408 response to each INVITE transaction fork that
  has not received a final response within 32 seconds (or 64 times SIP T1)
  after first final response to the INVITE was received.

- Added s2check library for writing check-based module tests for network protocols.

- User Via header with NULL host and port gets filled automatically

API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

<see previous release notes at
 http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/relnotes/ for examples ;
 - should include all changes to public headers, and
   other important information to developers;
 - and should be updated _continuously_! />

**template**: New features in API are marked with Doxytag macro @VERSION_1_XX_X.

libsofia-sip-ua:
- **template**: Added foobar() function (sofia-sip/foobar.h).
- Added functions auth_digest_ha1(), auc_save_credentials(), and
  auc_copy_credentials()
- Added function msg_fragment_clear_chain().
- Added tag SOATAG_DELAYED_OFFER_ENABLE().
- Added tags NUTAG_AUTO302(), NUTAG_AUTO305().
- Added functions nta_outgoing_magic(), nta_agent_tports(),
  nta_leg_client_reroute().
- Added functions su_home_parent(), su_root_clone(),
  su_root_set_max_defer(), su_root_get_max_defer(),
  su_timer_deferrable(), su_timer_is_set(), su_timer_latest(),
  su_task_deferrable(), su_task_wakeup().
- Added locale-independent, NULL-safe string comparison, matching and
  searching functions:
    su_strcmp(), su_strncmp(), su_strcasecmp(), su_strncasecmp(),
    su_strmatch(), su_strnmatch(), su_casematch(), su_casenmatch(),
    su_strncspn(), su_strnspn(), su_strcasestr(), su_memspn() and
    su_memcspn().
- The mp_len type was changed from usize_t to unsigned.
  The change is binary-incompatible on 64-bit platforms when compiled with
  the configure option --disable-size-compat
- Removed globals which should have been static in first place:
  - su_t64_to_time()
  - mutex_trylocker()
  - su_port_set_system_preferences()
  - t_null_next(), t_null_move(), t_null_dup(), t_null_copy(), t_null_find()
  - t_skip_next(), t_skip_move(), t_skip_len(), t_skip_dup(), t_skip_filter()
  - t_next_next(), t_next_move(), t_next_len(), t_next_dup(), t_next_filter()
  - t_filter_with(), t_any_filter()
  - sres_record_class(), urandom
  - u2s_alloc()
- This release is ABI/API compatible with applications linked against
  any 1.12.x release. However, applications built against this release won't
  work against an older library. The ABI has been tested with the nua module
  unit test (test_nua) built against original 1.12.0 release.

libsofia-sip-ua-glib:
- No ABI/API changes, compatible with 1.12.0. Note, libsofia-sip-ua-glib
  interface is not considered stable and may change in a future 1.12.x
  release.

Notes on TLS certificate validation
-----------------------------------

Jarod Neuner has improved certificate validation facilities of TLS
transport. Significant changes include:

1) The TLS handshake is no longer handled via transparent negotiation.
Certain static methods from tport.c were exposed to make this possible.

2) Certificate subjects are copied out of the peer certificate before
the first message is sent.  The stack can reject messages sent to an
untrusted peer.

3) The tport module can now report whether a secondary has a verified
certificate chain and the subjects of the peer certificate.

Added functions tport_is_verified(), tport_delivered_from_subjects(),
tport_subject_search().

Added tags TPTAG_TLS_PASSPHRASE(), TPTAG_TLS_VERIFY_POLICY(),
TPTAG_TLS_VERIFY_DEPTH(), TPTAG_TLS_VERIFY_DATE(), and
TPTAG_TLS_VERIFY_SUBJECTS().

Deprecated tag TPTAG_TLS_VERIFY_PEER().
