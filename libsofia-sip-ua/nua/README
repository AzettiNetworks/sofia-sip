Using nua_cli
=============

The nua example application, nua_cli, is a command line tool for testing
NUA.  It can be used to call, messaging, and as presence client.  Currently,
it works properly only on Linux.

To run the program:
-------------------
At least two nua_cli is needed to talk to each other. You must specify each ip/port
as follows at startup (sip:ip_address:port) eg.

./nua_cli sip:10.0.0.1:5060
and
./nua_cli sip:10.0.0.2:5061

There is also a script NUA which sets some sip environment variables which nua_cli
reads on startup which you can edit by hand if needed.

The commands are as follows:
----------------------------

  i - invite user, e.g., i sip:user@host
  b - bye user, tear down call
  c - cancel call request
  m - send an instant message, e.g., m sip:user@host
  ref - send a refer ref sip:user@host
  r - register, e.g., r sip:registrar.com
  u - unregister
  s - subscribe, e.g., s sip:user@host
  us - unsubscribe
  q, x - quit, exit

When a call is received, it can be either answered or declined:

  a - answer/accept
  d - decline
